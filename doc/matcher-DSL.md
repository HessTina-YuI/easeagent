# Matcher DSL
- [Overview](#Overview)
- [ClassMatcher](#ClassMatcher)
- [MethodMatcher](#MethodMatcher)

## Overview
EaseAgent provides a Matcher DSL (Domain Specific Language) to define a `Points` implementation which is used to defined classes and their methods to be enhanced. 

The design of this DSL is borrowed from bytebuddy's class and method matching DSL design. Why not use bytebuddy's DSL interface directly?
- Decouple from the ByteBuddy, Although the byteBuddy is an excellent bytecode framework, we provide dedicated DSL to developers via abstracting it, can easily migrate to a more excellent framework in the future.
- Provide a cleaner and easier to use API for Agent scenarios.


## ClassMatcher

### Definiton
As defined by the JVM Specification for the class structure and the status of the annotations commonly used in Java, the optional elements used for class matching contain:
- Class name.
- Implementing Interface name.
- Super class name.
- Modifier, access flags, public/private/abstract/final/synthetic, and so on.
- Annotation.

### Implemention
ClassMatcher definition is provided by `com.megaease.easeagent.plugin.matcher.ClassMatcher`.
Each condition in a matcher is a combination of `logical AND`.
```java
    private String name;
    // setup the match type of name: className, super className, Interface Name or Annotation name.
    private ClassMatch matchType;

    private int modifier = Modifier.ACC_NONE;
    private int notModifier = Modifier.ACC_NONE;
```

There is a `MethodMatcherBuilder` class in `com.megaease.easeagent.plugin.matcher.MethodMatcher`, providing interface to build a `ClassMatcher`.
The following methods are common condition settings in class matching, 
```java
    ClassMatcherBuilder hasSuperClass(String className)
    ClassMatcherBuilder hasClassName(String className)
    ClassMatcherBuilder hasAnnotation(String className)
    ClassMatcherBuilder hasInterface(String className)

    ClassMatcherBuilder isPublic();
    ClassMatcherBuilder isPrivate();
    ClassMatcherBuilder isAbstract();
    ClassMatcherBuilder isInterface();

    ClassMatcherBuilder notPrivate();
    ClassMatcherBuilder notAbstract();
    ClassMatcherBuilder notInterface();
```

### Logical Operation
- Logical AND  
As mention above, each condition in a matcher is a combination of `logical AND`.
For example, the following ClassMatcher will match non-interface classes which inherit the `java.lang.String` **and** implements the `java.lang.Comparable` interface.
```java
    ClassMatcher.builder()
        .hasSuperClass("java.lang.String")
        .hasInterface("java.lang.Comparable")
        .notInterface()
        .bilder()

```

- Logical OR  
`ClassMatcherBuilder` provides `or()` method which will finish current builder and start a new `ClassMatcherBuilder`.
The previous builder will generate a `Left ClassMatcher` and the new builder will generate a 'Right ClassMatcher'.
The `Left matcher` and `Right matcher` will be combined into one `OrClasssMatcher`, and a class will match as long as the `Left` or `Right` matcher is a match.
For example, the following ClassMatcher will match classes that implement the `javax.servlet.Filter` interface **or** inherit the "javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet" class.

```java
    public IClassMatcher getClassMatcher() {
        return ClassMatcher.builder()
            .hasInterface("javax.servlet.Filter")
            .or()
            .hasSuperClass("javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet")
            .build();
    }
```

- Logical NOT  
The `negate()` method of `ClassMatcherBuilder` uses `NegateClassMatcher` to wrap the original matcher generated by the builder when no such method is applied.
When a class matches the orignal matcher, it is unmatched by the wrap matcher; conversely, it is matched


## MethodMatcher

### Definiton
As defined by the JVM Specification for the method structure , the optional elements used for method matching contain:

- Method name.
- Modifer, public/private, and so on.
- Argument type, the full qualified class name of argument.
- ReturnType, the return type of a method.

### Implemention

MethodMatcher definition is provided by `com.megaease.easeagent.plugin.matcher.MethodMatcher`.
Each condition in a matcher is a combination of `logical AND`.
```java
    // method name
    private String name;

    // the match type of method name: equals, startWith...
    private StringMatch nameMatchType;

    // ignored when with default value
    private String returnType = null;
    // types of method arguments
    private String[] args;
    private int argsLength = -1;
    private int modifier = Modifier.ACC_NONE;
    private int notModifier = Modifier.ACC_NONE;

    // only match methods overrided form the ClassMatcher
    private IClassMatcher overriddenFrom = null;

    // assign a name for this method matcher
    private String qualifier;
```

There is a `MethodMatcherBuilder` class in `com.megaease.easeagent.plugin.matcher.MethodMatcher`, providing interface to build a `MethodMatcher`.
The following methods are common condition settings in method matching, 
```java
    // method name condition
    MethodMatcherBuilder named(String methodName);
    MethodMatcherBuilder isConstruct();
    MethodMatcherBuilder nameStartWith(String methodName);
    MethodMatcherBuilder nameEndWith(String methodName);
    MethodMatcherBuilder nameContains(String methodName);

    
    // modifier condition
    MethodMatcherBuilder isPublic();
    MethodMatcherBuilder isPrivate();
    MethodMatcherBuilder isAbstract();
    MethodMatcherBuilder isStatic();

    MethodMatcherBuilder notPublic();
    MethodMatcherBuilder notPrivate();
    MethodMatcherBuilder notAbstract();
    MethodMatcherBuilder notStatic();

    MethodMatcherBuilder returnType(String returnType);

    // setup method arguments condition
    MethodMatcherBuilder arg(int idx, String argType);
    MethodMatcherBuilder argsLength(int length);

    // setup method matcher name
    MethodMatcherBuilder qualifier(String qualifier);

    // only match methods overrided from matched classed through cMatcher
    MethodMatcherBuilder isOverriddenFrom(IClassMatcher cMatcher);
```


### Logical Operation
- Logical AND  
As mention above, each condition in a matcher is a combination of `logical AND`.
For example, the following MethodMatcher will match the method which named `getConnection` and with a return type of `java.sql.Connection`.
```java
    MethodMatcher.builder()
        .named("getConnection")
        .returnType("java.sql.Connection")
        .build())

```

In additon, `MethodMatcherBuilder` provides `and()` method which will finish current builder and start a new `MethodMatcherBuilder`.
The provious builder will generete a `Left MethodMatcher` and the new builder will generate a 'Right MethodMatcher'.
The `Left matcher` and `Right matcher` will be combined into one `AndMethodMatcher`, and a method will match as long as the `Left` or `Right` matcher is a match.

For example, the following matcher will match public methods that named `write` and exclude that with `void` return type.
```java
    MethodMatcher.builder()
        .named("write")
        .argsLength(1)
        .isPublic()
        .and()
        .returnType("void")
        .negate()
        .build()
```


- Logical OR  
`MethodMatcherBuilder` provides `or()` method which will finish current builder and start a new `MethodMatcherBuilder`.

The provious builder will generete a `Left MethodMatcher` and the new builder will generate a 'Right MethodMatcher'.
The `Left matcher` and `Right matcher` will be combined into one `OrMethodMatcher`, and a method will match as long as the `Left` or `Right` matcher is a match.
For example, the following MethodMatcher will match method that named `addBatch`  **or** named "clearBatch" and then give this `OrClasssMatcher` matcher a name `batch`.

```java
    MethodMatcher.builder()
        .named("addBatch")
        .or()
        .named("clearBatch")
        .qualifier("batch")
        .build()
```

- Logical NOT  
The `negate()` method of `MethodMatcherBuilder` uses `NegateMethodMatcher` to wrap the original matcher generated by builder when no such method is applied.

When a method matches the orignal matcher, it is unmatched by the wrap matcher; conversely, it is matched.
For example, the following matcher will match public methods that named `write` and exclude that with `void` return type.

```java
    MethodMatcher.builder()
        .named("write")
        .argsLength(1)
        .isPublic()
        .and()
        .returnType("void")
        .negate()
        .build()
```
